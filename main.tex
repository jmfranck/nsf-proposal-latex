\begin{pappg}
    Each proposal must contain a summary of the proposed project not more than one page in length. The
    Project Summary consists of an overview, a statement on the intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and
    a statement on the broader impacts of the proposed activity.

    The overview includes a description of the activity that would result if the proposal were funded and a
    statement of objectives and methods to be employed. The statement on intellectual merit should describe
    the potential of the proposed activity to advance knowledge. The statement on broader impacts should
    describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of
    specific, desired societal outcomes.

    The Project Summary should be informative to other persons working in the same or related fields, and,
    insofar as possible, understandable to a broad audience within the scientific domain. It should not be an
    abstract of the proposal.

    The Project Summary may ONLY be uploaded as a Supplementary Document if use of special characters
    is necessary. Such Project Summaries must be formatted with separate headings for Overview, Intellectual
    Merit and Broader Impacts. Failure to include these headings will result in the proposal being returned
    without review.
